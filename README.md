# Estimate calculation cost

## Calculation process

1. Prepare a structure
2. Optimize a structure
3. Heat your system
4. Get structures to use as initial structure in NVE simulation
5. Get trajectories to get flux and conductivities using CURP
6. Get flux and conductivities

This script calculate step6.
